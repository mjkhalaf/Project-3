# Project-3
For this project, DateTimeOne class was first writte. The default constructor declares a new calander and prints out the current date and time
at different time Zones. SleepforFiveSecond methods increases the current seconds gotten from the calander using simpledate formatting by 5, and a getter method for the seconds was
wrtitten as well. dateTimeDifferentZone puts the date and time at different time zones in a hashmap.and prints them out.TimeZoneHashMap puts 
the dates and times mentioned into different hashmaps and arraylist to be printed in the different styles mentioned in the prompt. After that 
dateTimeTwo class was written. The default constructor here gets the tenth and the eighteenth day of the current month. daysOfMonth methods 
takes two and inputs of year and month and gets the fifteenth and the last days of the month. compareYear method reads the file Dates.txt and
sorts the dates.datesHashMap takes the dates and puts them into a hashmap, and dateHashMap sorts the dates in the hashmap.After that MespAsceii
class was written to calculate the average of a station ID. MesoEquivilant Reads the file Mesonet and gets the statoins with the same average.
MesoLexicographical sorts the statoinID's. DateSortingUsingAlgorithm sorts the dates from the file SortingDates using bubble sort.
